Main features described as gait disorder manifesting in the first decade of life, followed by upper limb involvement observed in the second decade and sensorineural deafness usually manifesting in the second or third decade of life. CMT4D was first reported in the Bulgarian Romani community of Lom and to date, has mainly been associated with the Roma population. CMT4D is caused by a single ancestral mutation (p.R148X) in the NDRG1 gene (8q24) coding for the NDRG1 protein that has a role in the peripheral nervous system, possibly in Schwann cell signaling necessary for axonal survival. Transmission is autosomal recessive.	900000000000017005

Molecular diagnosis is made by PCR amplification of STS type sequences (sequence-tagged sites) from the AZFa, b, and c regions. All chromosome Y deletions do not necessarily lead to infertility: firstly, some deletions (especially some partial deletions) do not result in spermatogenesis defects; secondly, among men with severe oligospermia, some can father children without infertility treatment. Finally, when mature spermatozoa are found in the sperm or in the testicles, the infertility problem can be solved with medically assisted procreation techniques.

This anomaly of the hair shaft occurs in normal hair, pili canaliculi, or monilethrix and has been associated with the mosaic trisomy 8 syndrome, pseudomonilethrix type II or protein deficiency states. It can also be secondary to ulcerative colitis and extensive bowel resection. Caused by a transient duplication of the papilla's tip during the anagen phase, leading to the transitory production a two complete shafts, in the same follicular matrix, that emerge through a single pilary canal. When the two papilla tips fuse, both parallel branches form a single shaft again. When the transient duplication of the papilla tip occurs repetitively during the anagen phase, a series of bifurcation-fusion can be observed along the shaft. This situation is called pili multi-bifurcati. As a duplicated papilla tip can split again, a doubly bifurcated shaft may be observed: pili bi-bifurcati.	900000000000017005

This inherited disorder is transmitted following an autosomal recessive pattern. The optic atrophy is responsible for a moderate to severe visual impairment that appears early in life. The neurological manifestations can include myoclonic epilepsy, progressive spastic paraplegia due to pyramidal tract involvement, dysarthria, extra-pyramidal tract signs, ataxia, urinary incontinence, mental retardation, posterior column sensory loss or muscle contractures.	900000000000017005

This mutation lies in the seed sequence of microRNA-433 (hsa-miR-433) and abolishes the post-transcriptional regulation of HDAC6 expression by hsa-miR-433, resulting in the overexpression of the HDAC6 protein. Inheritance is X-linked dominant.	900000000000017005

The hearing loss may be described as sensorineural or it may be caused by auditory neuropathy. The hearing loss is either present at birth or begins in infancy, before the child learns to speak. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLITRK6 gene. The protein produced from this gene is found primarily in the inner ear and the eye. SLITRK6 gene mutations result in an abnormally short SLITRK6 protein that is not anchored properly to the cell membrane meaning the protein is unable to function normally. Impaired SLITRK6 protein function leads to abnormal nerve development in the inner ear and improperly controlled eyeball growth.	900000000000017005

The heart and digestive issues develop at the same time, usually by age 20. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the SGO1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex cohesin. This protein complex helps control the placement of chromosomes during cell division. Research suggests that SGO1 gene mutations may result in a cohesin complex that is less able to hold sister chromatids together, resulting in decreased chromosomal stability during cell division. This instability is thought to cause senescence of cells in the intestinal muscle and in the sinoatrial node, resulting in problems maintaining proper rhythmic movements of the heart and intestines.	900000000000017005

Caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the p110 alpha (p110α) protein, which is a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PIK3CA gene mutations associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome alter the p110α protein. The altered subunit makes PI3K abnormally active, which allows cells to grow and divide continuously. Increased cell proliferation leads to abnormal growth of the bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels.

Facial weakness (ptosis) and bulbar weakness (feeding difficulty), characteristic dysmorphic facial and skeletal abnormalities have been reported. Other neurological signs may include spasticity and seizures. Heterozygous female carriers may also be affected, but to a lesser degree (intellectual disability, distal muscle weakness, camptodactyly, joint contractures, and pes equinovarus).

In the three nonfamilial cases, unilateral pulmonary agenesis and microphthalmia were associated with diaphragmatic hernia and pulmonary vessel agenesis. It has been suggested that two different entities can be distinguished: on one hand, the association of anophthalmia-pulmonary hypoplasia with/without anomalies of the face, heart, spleen and uterus, which may be due to a putative autosomal recessive gene with pleiotropic effects; on the other hand, a sporadic association including pulmonary hypoplasia, anophthalmia, unilateral diaphragmatic defect and agenesis of the pulmonary trunk, which may represent the expression of a developmental field defect.

The disorder is heterogeneous and associated with partial abnormality of both Leydig cell and Sertoli cell function that may result from deletions or point mutations in the SRY gene or dose sensitive sex (NR0B1) locus duplication on the X chromosome. More important are mutations in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1, NR5A1, Ad4BP). SF-1 is a nuclear receptor and regulator of multiple genes involved in adrenal and gonadal development, steroidogenesis, and the reproductive axis. Therefore, affected patients may also have adrenal insufficiency. Syndromic forms have been associated with WT-1 mutations, which lead to variable testicular dysgenesis and an increased risk of renal abnormalities, namely Wilms tumors or nephrotic syndrome.	900000000000017005

Caused by a mutation in the ACAD9 gene (3q21.3) that encodes the protein ACAD9. This protein has only relatively recently been described but is quite widely expressed in tissues and has activity as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase with overlapping substrate specificity with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD). It also acts an assembly factor for complex I of the respiratory chain and therefore has a vital role in the production of a functioning mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Less than 60 families affected have been described. Clinical onset and course are insidious. Symptoms typically appear at an average age of 28 years, when the urinary concentrating ability is markedly reduced, producing polyuria and stable low urinary osmolality in the first morning urine and lack of any compensatory effect after endonasal desmopressin. End-stage renal disease typically occurs in the third-fifth decade of life or even later. Two genes have been linked to the disease: MCKD1 (1q21) and MCKD2 (in 16p12, where the gene UMOD, encoding uromodulin or Tamm-Horsfall protein, has been identified as responsible of the disease).	900000000000017005

It is thought to account for about 10% of all cases of cutaneous melanoma. Tends to occur earlier than non-familial melanoma. The risk of familial melanoma is closely related to a wide range of genetic alterations in susceptibility genes but also appears to be influenced by phenotypic risk factors, such as pigmentation, freckling and sun reactions. Complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are therefore thought to underlie the disease. The most common high-penetrance susceptibility gene implicated is CDKN2A, accounting for predisposition in approximately 20% of cases. In some affected families, susceptibility is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance but in most cases, a polygenic mode of inheritance appears likely.	900000000000017005

The disease usually manifests during the third decade of life with thenar muscle weakness resulting in reduced grip strength. The disease is slowly progressive and generally proceeds with calf muscle weakness appearing during the fourth decade and proximal muscles becoming perceptibly affected in the fifth decade. The disease is due to mutations on the actin-binding domain of the FLNC gene that encodes filamin C, a muscle specific filamin that is also associated with myofibrillar myopathy when mutations affect other parts of the protein.

The mutations found in 90% of PBD-ZSS patients are in the PEX1, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12 or PEX26 genes. Impaired metabolism results in the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids which damage developing neural cells. Accumulation of toxic bile acid intermediates damages the liver.

Focal seizures emanate from different cortical locations (temporal, frontal, centroparietal, parietal, parietal-occipital, occipital) in different family members, but for each individual a single focus remains constant throughout lifetime. Seizure type (tonic, tonic-clonic or hyperkinetic) and severity varies among family members and tends to decrease (but do not disappear) during adulthood. Many patients have an aura and show automatisms during diurnal seizures whereas others have nocturnal seizures. Most individuals are of normal intelligence but patients with intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been described.	900000000000017005

RRM2B gene mutations reduce the activity or amount of RNR, which likely impairs production of mitochondrial DNA nucleotides. Inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.	900000000000017005

Affected individuals can develop one or more types of neoplasm and affected members of the same family can have different types. Malignancies arise at a younger age, are often more aggressive and tend metastasize. The disease is caused by mutations in the BAP1 gene. In addition to a germline mutation in one copy of the gene, a second somatic mutation usually occurs in the normal copy of the gene in cells that give rise to neoplasms. Together, the germline and somatic mutations result in a complete loss of BAP1 protein function in tumor cells. Inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, in most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.

The broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes that the syndrome encompasses was previously divided into distinct syndromes (for example DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, cardiofacial syndrome) but are now known to be identical and are referred to as 22q11.2 deletion sydrome. In most cases, the syndrome is due to a 3 million base pair (Mb) deletion on the chromosomal region 22q11.2 that is flanked by low copy number repeats. The deletion is due to a non-allelic meiotic recombination during spermatogenesis or oogenesis. The variable expression of the 22q11.2 phenotype is thought to be due to genetic modifiers on either the other 22q11.2 allele or on other chromosomes.

Individuals may present with hyperplasia of the pituitary gland or a benign pituitary adenoma. Rarely both pituitary hyperplasia and an adenoma may be present. The abnormal pituitary gland releases excess amounts of growth hormone and in some cases excess amounts of growth hormone releasing hormone. Additional manifestations of the disorder include coarse facial features, acral enlargement, an increased appetite and acanthosis nigricans. Caused by duplication on the X chromosome, the duplication, often referred to as an Xq26.3 microduplication, occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q26.3. The disease follows an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. In females, the condition results from de novo duplications involving the GPR101 gene. In males, the condition often results from somatic mosaicism. Other affected males inherit the duplication from their affected mother.	900000000000017005

Syndromic forms have been associated with WT-1 mutations, which lead to variable testicular dysgenesis and an increased risk of renal abnormalities, namely Wilms tumours or nephrotic syndrome.	900000000000017005

Myxomas can be observed in the heart, skin and breast. Cardiac myxomas can develop in any cardiac chamber and may be multiple. One of the putative CNC genes located on 17q22-24, (PRKAR1A), has been found to encode the regulatory subunit (R1A) of protein kinase A. Heterozygous inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A were reported initially in 45 to 65% of CNC index cases, and may be present in about 80% of the CNC families presenting mainly with Cushing's syndrome.

The spectrum of clinical manifestations includes fever, malignant systemic and pulmonary hypertension, granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation of the liver, kidneys and lung. BS is due to an inherited or de novo mutation in the NOD2 gene (16q12), responsible for alterations in the innate immune response, inflammation and cell death. BS is an autosomal dominant disorder in the familial form.	900000000000017005

Fibronectin glomerulopathy may present at different ages, although mostly in adolescence or early adulthood, with typical features of a nephrotic syndrome including hypertension. Clustering of the disease within families indicates a genetic origin. In 40% of families, the disease is caused by heterozygous mutations in the FN1 gene (2q34) encoding fibronectin. Whole-genome linkage analysis in a large pedigree showed another disease locus on 1q32, however no specific candidate genes has been identified so far. Segregation with disease appearance in successive generations is consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with age-related penetrance.	900000000000017005

The structure is delimited superiorly by an artificial plane that extends from the symphysis pubis to the superior iliac crests; and inferiorly by the superior pelvic aperture. The structure contains the cavity of the false pelvis, which is bounded on either side by the ilium; and in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the anterior borders of the ilia. It forms the inferior volume of the abdomen proper cavity which includes a number of parts of structures of the intra-abdominal proper e.g. historically the cavity of false pelvis has been described as containing the 'iliac colon' which is a segment of the descending colon within the volume of the false pelvis. Teleologically it supports the intestines by transmitting part of their weight to the anterior wall of the abdomen.	900000000000017005

Since the first publication in 1991, only 11 patients have been described. Neonates with PAGOD syndrome present with several visceral anomalies: hypoplasia of right or left lung, diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele, various cardiac anomalies including, amongst others atrial septal defect, left ventricular hypoplasia or ventricular septal defect and great vessels anomalies such as aortic hypoplasia and pulmonary artery hypoplasia or atresia. Cardiac and mediastinal structures may be in dextroposition. Ambiguous external genitalia can be observed in some cases and all present gonadal agenesis or hypoplasia and developmental anomalies of Wolffian and Mullerian duct structures. Vitamin A deficiency has been suggested to play a role in the development of the syndrome. Almost all cases are sporadic.	900000000000017005

The first manifestation of the disease (usually candidiasis) occurs in childhood with other manifestations appearing progressively. The most common autoimmune endocrine involvement is hypoparathyroidism (79-96% of cases). Adrenal failure most often manifests with concurrent mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency (78% of cases). The disease is caused by mutations of the AIRE gene (21q22.3) coding for the AIRE transcription factor, which is involved in immune tolerance mechanisms and contributes to the negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleen. Transmission is autosomal recessive.	900000000000017005

The disease usually presents in infants aged 3 to 6 months with systemic manifestations of hepatosplenomegaly and an early onset and severe neurological syndrome. This is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the GBA gene (1q21) that codes for the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase. The deficiency in glucocerebrosidase leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramidase (or beta-glucocerebrosidase) deposits in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, of the spleen and the bone marrow (Gaucher cells).

Disease onset is in the neonatal period. Patients have a long face, a high-arched palate and a tented upper lip. Skeletal anomalies may include kyphoscoliosis, pectus carinatum and pes cavus. In the first year of life, hypotonia and facial weakness are present and often contribute to failure to thrive and delayed motor development. Anti-gravity movements are present and respiratory muscle involvement is frequent. Nocturnal hypoxia and hypercarbia and lower respiratory tract infections are common manifestations. Joint hypermobility can be observed. In a minority of children weakness is more distal. Progression is very slow or absent and most patients are able to live an independent active life. The disease is caused by mutations of the ACTA1 (1q42.13), NEB (2q22) or TPM2 (9p13) genes, and disease transmission can be autosomal recessive or dominant.	900000000000017005

Epstein syndrome, Fechtner syndrome, May-Hegglin anomaly and Sebastian syndrome, previously described as distinct disorders, represent some of the different clinical presentations of MYH9-RD. MYH9-RD is due to mutations in the MYH9 gene (22q13.1), encoding the heavy chain of the isoform A of the non-muscle myosin of class II (myosin-9).
